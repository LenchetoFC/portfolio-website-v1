# Personal Website
As of now, this website is more of an semi-interactive version of my resume. As I learn more web dev techniques and tricks and designs, I will implement them into this website. Along with my paper resume, this digital resume will be updated.

## Description
This website displays my resume using static and non-static design elements to demonstrate my current web development skills.
